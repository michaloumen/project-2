## About the project
This is our second project within the Ironhack bootcamp where we developed a website using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

Was development by [Mayara Manso](https://github.com/myrmanso) and [Michelle Mendon√ßa](https://github.com/michaloumen).

The objective of the project is to attend some technological demands of a dental office.
The website has a home page with general information about the clinic, such as the type of treatment provided (specialty), curriculum of professional dentists, contact information and office location.
The product was designed to be used by both dentists and patients. Therefore, it has a part for registration and login of two types of users. For the dentist to register, he needs to have access to a protected route that serves as a pre-registration. This route asks for a password that takes him to the dentist's registration page. When logged into the platform, it will be possible to access the patient's schedule and make appointments through the date-picker system. There is also a possibility (still under construction) to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) patients from the system. However, this option is not yet connected to the date-picker or database.

## Installing
