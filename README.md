## About the project
<p>This is our second project within the Ironhack bootcamp where we developed a website using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.</p><br>
<p>The objective of the project is to attend some technological demands of a dental office.
The website has a home page with general information about the clinic, such as the type of treatment provided (specialty), curriculum of professional dentists, contact information and office location.</p><br>
<p>The product was designed to be used by both dentists and patients. Therefore, it has a part for registration and login of two types of users. for the dentist to register, he needs to have access to a protected route that serves as a pre-registration. This route asks for a password that takes him to the dentist's registration page. When logged into the platform, it will be possible to access the patient's schedule and make appointments through the date-picker system. There is also a possibility (still under construction) to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) patients from the system. However, this option is not yet connected to the date-picker or database.</p>

## Installing
